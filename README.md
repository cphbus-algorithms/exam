# Exam information for Algorithms and Data structures

## Questionnaire

The questionnaire is mandatory!

The time of the questionnaire is Wednesday 24th 12:30-16:00.

The aim of the questionnaire is to test your skills broadly in the curriculum. The result of the questionnaire will be the foundation of the oral exam. It is not possible to fail the exam alone on the results of the questionnaire.

As preparation, you should focus on how concrete algorithms works and their complexity (big O). You are expected to be able to:

* sketch out a specific algorithm in code (pseudocode is ok)
* sketch out a specific data structure 
* recognise algorithms based on the data they produce
* explain the workings of algorithms in English (or Danish)

You are expected to know:

* Insertion sort and selection sort
* Merge sort and quick sort
* Binary search and binary search trees (BST)
* Balanced trees
* Symbol tables
* Hashing
* Heaps and heap sort
* Queues and priority queues
* Graphs, weighted/unweighted, directed/undirected
* Tries
* Regular expression (idea)
